# ClickSafe

### Key Features:
Risk scoring system - assigns points for different red flags
Three risk levels - Safe, Suspicious, Dangerous
Confidence scoring - shows how certain the analysis is
Detailed reasons - explains why something is flagged
Actionable suggestions - helps users understand what to do

### Detection Methods:
URL shortener detection
Suspicious domain patterns
Phishing keyword detection
IP address usage (red flag)
HTTPS checking
Trusted domain whitelist

The scoring system is pretty intuitive - more red flags = higher risk score = more dangerous classification. You can easily tune the thresholds and add more detection rules as you discover new scam patterns.

### TODO -
Domain age checking
SSL certificate validation
Integration with threat intelligence APIs
Machine learning for pattern detection
